These included redesigning the solid rocket boosters, improving monitoring systems for critical components like the O-rings, and implementing more rigorous testing procedures.\n",
      "Today marks the 33rd anniversary of this tragic event, which remains etched in our collective memory as a reminder of both the dangers and promises of space exploration. May we never forget those who lost their lives pursuing scientific discovery and pushing the boundaries of what is possible.\n",
